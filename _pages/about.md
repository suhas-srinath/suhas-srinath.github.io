**PhD Candidate in Computer Vision**  
Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru

---

I'm a computer vision researcher focused on **self-supervised learning** and **domain generalization** for robust AI systems. My work enables models to generalize from seen to unseen domains through physics-informed and application-specific self-supervision.

My research has been published at top venues including **WACV (Oral - Top 3%)**, **IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging**, and **ICIP**. I work primarily with **PyTorch**, **diffusion models**, and **test-time adaptation** for real-world applications in underwater imaging, medical imaging, and generative AI.

**Currently seeking full-time research positions in multimodal AI, video-language models, and generative models. Available to start immediately.**
