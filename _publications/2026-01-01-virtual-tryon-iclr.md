**Under Review at ICLR 2026**

This paper presents a novel framework for source-free test-time adaptation in diffusion-based virtual try-on applications. The method enables robust performance when deployed in new domains without requiring access to the original training data.

**Key Contributions:**
- Source-free test-time adaptation strategy for diffusion models in virtual try-on scenarios
- Comprehensive baseline comparisons and evaluation framework
- Robust performance across domain shifts without accessing source domain data
- Novel adaptation techniques tailored for generative virtual try-on systems

[Paper will be available upon publication]
