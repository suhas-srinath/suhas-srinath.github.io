This paper presents UnDIVE, a framework for generalized underwater video enhancement that leverages generative priors to handle the diverse degradations present in underwater imagery. The method addresses the unique challenges of underwater video processing caused by wavelength-dependent attenuation and scattering.

**Key Contributions:**
- Novel application of generative priors for underwater video enhancement
- Robust performance across varying water conditions and depths
- Physics-informed approach to underwater image restoration
