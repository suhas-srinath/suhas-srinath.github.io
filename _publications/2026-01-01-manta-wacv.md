**Accepted to WACV 2026**

This paper presents MANTA, a physics-informed framework for underwater object tracking that addresses the unique challenges posed by wavelength-dependent attenuation and scattering in underwater environments.

**Key Contributions:**
- Dual-positive contrastive learning strategy coupling temporal consistency with Beer-Lambert law-based augmentations for features robust to both temporal and underwater distortions
- Multi-stage tracking pipeline with physics-informed secondary association algorithm integrating geometric consistency and appearance similarity for re-identification under occlusion and drift
- Novel evaluation metrics: Center-Scale Consistency (CSC) and Geometric Alignment Score (GAS) to assess geometric fidelity
- State-of-the-art results on multiple underwater tracking benchmarks (WebUOT-1M, UOT32, UTB180, UWCOT220)
