This paper presents GenSelfDiff-HIS, a framework that leverages generative self-supervision through diffusion models for histopathological image segmentation. The method addresses the challenge of limited annotated medical imaging data by using self-supervised learning with diffusion-based generative priors.

**Key Contributions:**
- Novel application of diffusion-based generative self-supervision for medical image segmentation
- Robust performance across diverse histopathological tissue types and staining protocols
- Self-supervised learning approach reducing dependency on large annotated datasets
- Domain generalization capabilities for histopathological image analysis
