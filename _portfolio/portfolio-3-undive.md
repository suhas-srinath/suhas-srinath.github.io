## Generalized Underwater Video Enhancement Using Generative Priors

**Project Overview**

UnDIVE addresses the critical challenge of enhancing underwater video quality where traditional enhancement methods fail due to the complex, physics-driven degradations unique to underwater environments. The framework leverages generative priors to achieve robust enhancement across varying water conditions.

**Key Challenges Addressed**

**Underwater-Specific Degradations:**
- Wavelength-dependent light attenuation (red light absorbed first)
- Scattering effects varying with water turbidity
- Depth-dependent color shifts
- Temporal consistency in video sequences
- Variation across different water bodies (ocean, lake, river)

**Technical Innovation**

**Generative Priors Framework:**
- Leverages powerful generative models for underwater image restoration
- Learns priors from diverse underwater conditions
- Adapts to varying degradation patterns without explicit modeling
- Maintains temporal consistency across video frames

**Physics-Informed Approach:**
- Incorporates understanding of underwater light propagation
- Accounts for depth-dependent degradation patterns
- Handles multiple simultaneous degradation factors
- Generalizes across different water clarity conditions

**Applications**

- **Marine Research:** Enhanced video quality for species identification and behavior analysis
- **Underwater Cinematography:** Professional video production in challenging conditions
- **Robotic Navigation:** Improved visual feedback for autonomous underwater vehicles
- **Infrastructure Inspection:** Clearer footage for subsea structure assessment
- **Archaeological Documentation:** Better visualization of underwater heritage sites

**Key Advantages**

- Robust performance across diverse underwater environments
- No requirement for paired clean-degraded training data
- Handles complex, multi-factor degradation scenarios
- Maintains video temporal coherence
- Generalizes to unseen water conditions

**Technical Stack**

- Diffusion models / Generative modeling
- Physics-based underwater image formation
- Video processing and temporal modeling
- Domain adaptation techniques
